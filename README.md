# Military-Equipment-and-Services_Competitor-Analysis
Hey! Welcome to my Defense and Security Systems' Insights Repository. GCC has been heavily reliant on imports; Hence, data of imports of military equipment is highly reliable for Defense and Security Systems RD organizations in the region to identify relevant opportunities to grow. Import data shows much of what the warfighter needs on the battlefield. Hence, the visualizations in this repository could be used as a starting point to; (a) direct an organization's long-term strategy, (b) evaluate current projects in the pipeline and develop a framework to redirect initiatives towards meaningful growth
